**Hello everyone!**

Here we go for a new video! I’m going to talk about my experience on my first day at work, my tasks, the company environment, and give you some tips. Let’s go!

I’m an apprentice DevOps at CNRS. Before my first day, I was excited but also nervous because it was my first job. During my interview, my tutor told me we would work with new technologies like Docker, LDAP, Watchdogs, setting up networks, creating and configuring servers, and reprogramming automates. But I had no experience with networks or automate reprogramming. Also, we are only two people working on this project, which made me feel more stressed.

But on my first day, everything went well! I went to the office, and my tutor introduced me to all the teams, researchers, and their projects. He showed me the site, including the climatic cells, where they test different climates (like China or the USA in 1955) on plants to see their reactions.

Then, he gave me a laptop, and I spent the whole day installing Ubuntu, creating my professional email, and learning about my leave days, holidays, and company benefits. It was a good day because I didn’t have to start real work yet!

**On the second day**, we had a meeting about the project and my tasks. Our project is called **Octopus**. The goal is to install a server on-site and create a remote control for the climatic cells. This remote control will allow researchers to change settings or start experiments without coming to the site. This is a big advantage and may also bring new researchers to work with us.

For this, we need a web server, LDAP, and Docker. That’s why we are using these tools.

**Some advice for you**:

1. My tutor told me that developers in any language will get more jobs if they document their work well. Someone who doesn’t know coding should understand what you did. Many developers can code, but only some can explain their work clearly. If you write good documentation, you will stand out and have more opportunities.
    
    To show companies that you document well, use platforms like GitHub or GitLab to share your projects with a README file. Add this to your CV!
    
2. Write down everything you do. For example, if you install or configure something, take notes. Later, if you do a similar project, you can check your notes, avoid mistakes, and work faster. This will make you more independent.

4. Don’t be afraid to ask questions. It’s okay to say, 'I don’t understand' or 'I don’t know how to do this.' What matters most is being curious, asking for help, and moving forward with your tasks, instead of losing time by staying stuck.
